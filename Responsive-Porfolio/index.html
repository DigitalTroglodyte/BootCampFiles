      <p>I develop revenue generating websites through multiple channels including display advertising, content marketing, lead generation, social media channels and event marketing.

        In my spare time I enjoy working on computers, playing guitar, working out and spending time with my fiance and cats.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Throughout my life I have had a fascination with technology starting with the Packard Bell my dad had back in the early 90's.  Although I mostly used it to play Wolfenstein or Doom back then I am still intrigued by computers.
        I put that fasciation to work now daily when I build site and app solutions.  I feel lucky to be able to have a strong passion in what I do for work.
